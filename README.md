## ðŸ§  Core Logic & How It Works

### State Management

The application's state is managed centrally in `App.tsx` using the `useReducer` hook. This approach provides a robust and predictable way to handle state transitions.

- **`initialState`**: Defines the default state of the application, including the book list, current track, player status, bookmarks, etc.
- **`appReducer`**: A pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state. Actions are dispatched from various components to update the UI (e.g., `SET_PLAYING`, `ADD_BOOKMARK`).

### Audio Playback

- The core audio functionality is handled by a single `<audio>` element in `App.tsx`.
- `useRef` is used to maintain a persistent reference to this element.
- `useEffect` hooks listen for changes in `currentTrack`, `isPlaying`, `playbackRate`, and `volume`. When these state variables change, the `useEffect` hook imperatively updates the audio element (e.g., `audioRef.current.play()`, `audioRef.current.pause()`, `audioRef.current.src = ...`).
- Event listeners (`timeupdate`, `loadedmetadata`, `ended`) are attached to the audio element to update the application state, such as progress and duration, or to automatically play the next chapter.

### Data Flow

1.  **Fetching Data**: On initial load, the `App` component fetches the audiobook library data from `/manifest.json`.
2.  **Component Props**: The state is passed down as props from `App.tsx` to child components (`BookCarousel`, `BookView`, etc.).
3.  **Callback Handlers**: Child components communicate back up to the `App` component via callback functions passed as props (e.g., `onSelectBook`, `onPlayPause`). These callbacks dispatch actions to the reducer, which updates the state and triggers a re-render of the application.

### Persistence

To enhance the user experience, WhisperShelf persists key data to the browser's `localStorage`:

- **Player State (`PLAYER_STATE_KEY`)**: The current book ID, chapter number, playback progress, volume, and speed are saved automatically. This allows users to close the app and resume their listening session later.
- **Bookmarks (`BOOKMARKS_KEY`)**: All user-created bookmarks are saved, ensuring they are not lost between sessions.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This project is set up to run in a modern browser without a complex build process, thanks to ES Modules and import maps.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- A local web server to serve the files. The [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code is a great option.

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jakharanchit/whispershelf.git
    cd whispershelf
    ```

2.  **Serve the files:**
    - Open the project folder in VS Code.
    - If you have the Live Server extension, right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

3.  **Open in browser:**
    - The application should now be running and accessible at the local server address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5500`).

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements

- **Dark Mode**: Implement a theme switcher for a comfortable viewing experience in low-light environments.
- **PWA Functionality**: Add a service worker to enable offline access to audiobooks.
- **Custom Library**: Allow users to upload their own audiobook files.
- **Testing**: Introduce unit and integration tests using a framework like Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Animations**: Add more subtle animations and transitions to further enhance the user experience.
